# The Quantified Self
Nowadays more personal information is collected than ever before. Yet, as an everyday consumer it can be challenging and cumbersome to gain insights in your self-generated data, let alone get a grip on all these digital records. But it oftentimes doesn't get that far: data ownership is claimed by commercial parties while your data is typically hidden right in front of your own eyes. It is not for nothing that people came up with the analogy "data is the new gold"; data literally has a high price tag and it therefore doesn't come as a surprise that the number of self-quantification tools which actually allow you to export usage data can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

There are a few exceptions to the rule though, in fact this notebook demonstrates that personal records generated by a device almost all millenials actively use, a mobile-phone, can provide far-reaching and profound insights into someone's everyday behaviour without its user even consciously realizing it.
